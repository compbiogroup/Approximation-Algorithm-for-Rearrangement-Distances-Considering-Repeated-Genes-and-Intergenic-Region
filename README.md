# Approximation-Algorithm-for-Rearrangement-Distances-Considering-Repeated-Genes-and-Intergenic-Region

Partition and distance algorithms necessary to ensure an Theta(k) approximation for rearrangement distances considering multiple genes and intergenic region sizes as described in the paper "Approximation Algorithm for Rearrangement Distances Considering Repeated Genes and Intergenic Regions". The `partition` folder contains the partition algorithm and the `distance` folder contains the distance algorithm.

## Instances

Some generated instances are available in the `database` folder. Each file in `REVX_RANDSTR` was generated with the aplication of X reversions, each file in `TRANSX_RANDSTR` was generated with the application of X transpositions, and each file in `REVTRANSX_RANDSTR` was generated with the application of floor of X/2 reversals and ceil of X/2  transpositions. In the file names, `LX` represents the size of the alphabet used to generated the instances.
