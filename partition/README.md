# Approximation for Minimum Common Intergenic String Partition

A 2k approximation algorithm for the Minimum Common Intergenic String Partition, the Signed Minimum Common Intergenic String Partition, and the Reverse Minimum Common Intergenic String Partition problems, where k in the maximum number of copies of a given character in the strings.

## Usage

Compile the code by running `make` and see the running options with `./MCISP2K --help`. A program to produce test instances is also available, see `./DB --help`.
